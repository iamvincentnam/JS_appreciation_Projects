Here is a pet (cat & dog) picture web application just created using Html, Bootstraps 5 CSS & Javascript.
It uses a JS fetch function to reach out to an external API to get some data after which it renders into the HTML DoM some random pet photos.
It Runs on the principle of Async JavaScript whereby upon request, it goes out on its own to carry out a function(fetch)
then, It produces a desired result after it has succeeded  thereby allowing other (synchronous) activities in the code to continue to run without being stalled.
