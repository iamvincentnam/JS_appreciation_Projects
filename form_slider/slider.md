the form slider  is made up of a  four boxes each with two of the boxes placed side by side to eachother. 
the log in form has an overlay panel is placed to its right hand side. 
the log in form has a Sign UP overlay placed by its side while the Sign up form has a LogIn Overlay panel placed by its side too.
A javascript was used to set the Z-index of the inactive one lower so that it hides under the active one until when the respective overlay panel which is visible is clicked.
then, a translation animation to bring the respective   form (either Login or Sign Up) out of invisibility plays out.
